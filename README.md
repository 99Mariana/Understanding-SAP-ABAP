# Understanding-SAP-ABAP

After 2 years of experience working as a SAP ABAP technical consultant, I wanted to go further and deepen my knowledge in the area far beyond of building lines of code.

Quoting one of the phrases that most impacted me during my academic path: **"You can only say that you really know something when you are able to explain it."**
And why not challenge me to explain it to myself?

This project came up as a result of my desire to deepen my knowledge of sap abap, my curiosity to know how things really work and my desire to see answers to the most diverse questions that have been wandering around in me. If, like me, you have the same curiosity, this repository will be ideal for you!
