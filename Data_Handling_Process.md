### Introduction

> [Data Handling Process](#Data_Handling_Process) > [Content](#Content) > [This section](#Introduction)

In this section, we will explore different commands that allow us to handle data. Data handling in SAP ABAP is a sensitive and very important process. It ensures **accurate and reliable data** for business decisions, keeps the system running **efficiently**, and protects sensitive information. It helps with **quick data retrieval**, supports **real-time updates**,  ensures that data from different systems is handled smoothly, and helps automate business processes while keeping the data **consistent and secure**.

### Handling Data in Database Tables

In a simple way, the process that occurs when you execute a command for handling data involves the following steps:

1. **Open Database Connection:** ABAP interacts with the SAP database through a database interface. This interface is responsible for sending SQL commands to the database system.

2. **Check Syntax and Prepare the SQL Statement:** The SQL statement is checked for syntax errors and prepared for execution.

3. **Send and Process the SQL Statement:** The prepared SQL statement is then sent to the database system, which processes the statement and updates the relevant table(s) in the database.

4. **Locking Mechanism:** During the ```UPDATE``` operation, for instance, the database places a lock on the records being modified. This lock prevents other transactions from accessing the same records simultaneously, ensuring data consistency.

5. **Commit or Rollback:** If the operation is successful, a commit statement is issued, making the changes permanent in the database. If an error occurs during the execution of the SQL commands, a rollback is issued, which reverts the database to its previous state.

6. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):** Many databases use a write-ahead logging mechanism to ensure that changes can be recovered in case of a failure. The operation is recorded in the log before it is committed to the database.

7. **Release Locks:** Once the transaction is committed, the locks placed on the records are released, making them available for other transactions.

8. **Return Status:** The ABAP program receives a status return code from the database indicating the success or failure of the command executed.
   


### Handling Data in Internal Tables

Unlike database tables, internal tables are handled entirely in memory within the SAP application server. Some key differences between these two processes include: Locking is not applied to internal tables since they are not shared resources outside of the current ABAP program or session; No commit or rollback operations are required or applicable for internal tables, as they are temporary and exist only for the duration of the programâ€™s execution.
