### Introduction

SAP created Business Process Exception Management (BPEM) to help users handle process exceptions effectively. The primary goal of BPEM is to present a concise overview of system operations and to manage exceptions efficiently. It gives users an overview of chosen business processes within the SAP environment, mainly by automatically assessing application log messages. Through BPEM, users can monitor all activities related to application log analysis, especially those generated by high-volume batch processing (mass activities) as well as real-time processing. This functionality saves agents significant time and boosts productivity by eliminating the need for manual retrieval of information from the system.

When issues are detected, BPEM allows the creation of clarification cases that can be assigned to specific agents or teams for further investigation and resolution. Automatically generated clarification cases enable a structured, guided approach to resolving issues, ensuring cases are routed to the appropriate departments or agents for swift resolution. As agents work through these cases, tracking their resolution can help improve business process quality and performance over time.

Managing these issues manually is usually time-consuming, but BPEM simplifies the process by reducing the time needed for log analysis and allowing direct navigation from error messages to the associated business objects, streamlining issue resolution.
