User dialogs refer to the mechanisms created to facilitate interaction with the user, including interactive interfaces and series of screens. In ABAP, user dialogs are designed to guide users through specific workflows, allowing them to input data, make selections, and trigger various business processes within the system. These dialogs are essential for providing a seamless, user-friendly experience in complex SAP applications.
