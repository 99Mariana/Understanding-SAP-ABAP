Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in SAP ABAP offers a modern, structured approach to software development, focusing on the organization of data and functionality into reusable components called objects.

In ABAP, OOP enables developers to design software around real-world objects, focusing on encapsulating data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into classes. This approach enhances flexibility and scalability, making it easier to manage large, complex SAP systems. Key principles of OOP, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, are fully supported in ABAP, allowing developers to create dynamic, extensible applications that seamlessly integrate with SAP’s core functionalities.

In this section we will take a deep look of the concepts of OOP in ABAP, such as defining classes, creating objects, and understanding important concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and exception handling. We will also explore practical applications, highlighting how OOP in ABAP improves code quality comparing to the tradiotional procedural programing.

#### OOP Concepts

**Class** - is a template of objects which can handle more than one characteristics. It defines the properties (attributes) and actions (methods) that the object will have.

**Objects** - is an instance of a class. It represents a specific example of a class with its own unique set of attribute values.

**Attributes** - Attributes are variables,structures or tables, defined in a class to hold the object’s data.

**Methods** - Methods are actions or functions that objects of a class can perform.
