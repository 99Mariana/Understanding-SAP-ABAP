Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in SAP ABAP offers a modern, structured approach to software development, focusing on the organization of data and functionality into reusable components called objects.

In ABAP, OOP enables developers to design software around real-world objects, focusing on encapsulating data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into classes. This approach enhances flexibility and scalability, making it easier to manage large, complex SAP systems. Key principles of OOP, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, are fully supported in ABAP, allowing developers to create dynamic, extensible applications that seamlessly integrate with SAPâ€™s core functionalities.



This section will cover the foundational concepts of OOP in ABAP, such as defining classes, creating objects, and understanding important concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and exception handling. We will also explore practical applications, highlighting how OOP in ABAP improves code quality and eases system upgrades and maintenance within SAP environments.

Unlike traditional procedural programming, OOP in ABAP models real-world entities by encapsulating data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into classes. This shift has greatly improved the efficiency and maintainability of SAP applications, enabling developers to handle complex business requirements more effectively.
