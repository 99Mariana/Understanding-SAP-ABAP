### Select Statement

> [Data Selection Process](#Data_Selection_Process) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#select-statement)

In simple terms, a `SELECT` statement in SAP ABAP is an Open SQL command used to retrieve data from database tables based on specific conditions and store the results in appropriate ABAP data objects.


### What Is Happening During The Data Selection Process?

> [Data Selection Process](#Data_Selection_Process) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#what-is-happening)

What happens during the data retrieval process performed in a select statement? This question has been a big enigma for me for a long time, and researching and really understanding the process has helped me improve the way I've been programming from then on. The process of data retrieval is summarized in the diagram below:

Letâ€™s take a deeper look at the process:

 1. **ABAP Code Execution:** ABAP programs are executed by the Application Server, which allocates resources (like work processes) to run the code.

 2. **Database Interface Processing:** This interface acts as a bridge between the ABAP application and the database. It performs two key tasks: converting ABAP SQL to native SQL and optimizing the query. In ABAP, when you write a `SELECT` statement, you are using ABAP Open SQL, a standardized SQL language provided by SAP that allows developers to write database queries without worrying about the specific SQL dialect of the underlying database (such as Oracle, SAP HANA, or Microsoft SQL Server). Therefore, converting ABAP SQL to native SQL is an essential step in database communication. Before sending the SQL query to the database, the database interface optimizes the query for performance, including the use of buffers or indexes.

 3. **Query Execution on the Database Server:** The primary function of the database server is to store and manage tables, which are saved in the database's disk storage but accessed in memory when queried. The database management system (DBMS) executes the query, evaluates the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause, and uses the query processor to filter, sort, and aggregate the requested data.

 4. **Data Transfer:** In this step, the DBMS returns the resulting data to the application server. This communication process occurs via a network connection.

 5. **Storage in ABAP Memory and Program Use:** The application server receives the information and stores it in suitable ABAP objects (such as internal tables, work areas, or variables) for further processing in the ABAP program.


### What Can You Do In a Select?

> [Data Selection Process](#Data_Selection_Process) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#what-can-you-do)

When using the `SELECT` statement is possible to adapt it by incorporating aggregation functions, conditions, filters, string manipulations, field operations, grouping, and sorting. Additionally, multiple tables can join multiple tables and limited the amount of data retrieved in the end of the query execution. 

#### AGGREGATION FUNCTIONS

| Functionality | Example  | Description    |
| :----------- | :--------------: | -------------------------: |
| COUNT | ```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table INTO @data(lv_count)```  | Counts the number of records that match the condition |                  | SUM   | ```SELECT SUM(field) FROM table INTO @data(lv_sum)```  | Calculates the sum of the values of a numeric field   |
| AVG   | ```SELECT AVG(field) FROM table INTO @data(lv_avg)```  | Calculates the average of the values of a numeric field |
| MIN   | ```SELECT MIN(field) FROM table INTO @data(lv_min)```  | Finds the smallest value of a numeric field |

### Dynamic Select statement

> [Data Selection Process](#Data_Selection_Process) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#dynamic_select)

Dynamic programming techniques can pose significant security risks if not handled correctly. Therefore, it's important to be careful and validate any content coming from external sources that is used in dynamic statements. This can be done using the ```CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG``` system class.

You can create dynamic SELECT statements at different levels, such as:

-	**Fields/Columns**: Dynamically specifying which fields to select from the database.
-	**Table Names**: Dynamically choosing which database table to query.
-	**Conditions**: Dynamically building the WHERE clause based on runtime conditions.

**Code example:**

``` ABAP
  data: lv_table      type dd02l-tabname,
        lv_fields     type string,
        itab(100)     occurs 0 with header line,
        lv_conditions type string,
        lt_result     type table of sflight.

  " Framework takes table name, fields, and conditions as input
  lv_table      = 'SFLIGHT'.
  lv_fields     = 'CARRID, CONNID'.

  move 'CARRID = ''LH'' AND CONNID = 455' to itab.
  append itab.

  " Dynamic SELECT for a generic data extraction framework
  select (lv_fields)
    from (lv_table)
    where (itab)
    into table @lt_result.

  if sy-subrc ne 0.
    clear lt_result.
  endif.

"Declaration inline is not posible with the fields or tables define in a variavel.
  select carrid,
         connid
    from sflight
    where (itab)
    into table @data(lt_result2).

  if sy-subrc = 0.
    clear lt_result2.
  endif.
```


Main possible reasons to create a dynamic `SELECT`:

- **Flexible Queries Based on User Input:** When there is a need to create a tool that adapts to user specifications entered in the selection screen.

- **Building Generic Reports:** To add flexibility in the columns displayed as the output of the retrieval process. Dynamic SQL allows the report to adapt based on the userâ€™s preferences or configuration, making it more versatile.

- **Handling Different Database Tables:** In applications where the database table to query from is determined at runtime (e.g., based on user choices or configuration), dynamic SQL enables the program to adjust which table it selects data from without hardcoding all possible table names.

- **Optimizing Performance for Specific Scenarios:** By using dynamic SQL, you can tailor your queries to fetch only the necessary fields based on specific conditions. This optimization reduces the amount of data transferred and processed, leading to better performance.


###Online vs. batch execution modes: How to handle large data sets in SAP ABAP?

> [Data Selection Process](#Data_Selection_Process) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#large_datasets)

First, it is important to know that the online and batch execution of programs depends on the resources that are allocated to the application server part, which are defined by parameters such as:

- ```abap/heap_area_dia```: Defines the maximum amount of private memory that can be used by each individual user in online mode.
- ```abap/heap_area_nondia```: Defines the maximum amount of private memory that can be used by each individual user in batch mode.
- ```abap/heap_area_total```: Specifies the maximum amount of memory that can be used across all processes (both online and batch) in the entire SAP instance.
- ```ztta/roll_area```: Determines how much memory is reserved for each user session to store their context data (e.g., data, variables).
- ```ztta/roll_extension```: Specifies the size of the extended memory, which is a shared memory area used by all processes to store user data.
