### Select Statement

> [Data Selection Process](#Data_Selection_Process) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#select-statement)

In simple terms, a `SELECT` statement in SAP ABAP is an Open SQL command used to retrieve data from database tables based on specific conditions and store the results in appropriate ABAP data objects.


### What Is Happening During The Data Selection Process?

> [Data Selection Process](#Data_Selection_Process) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#what-is-happening)

What happens during the data retrieval process performed in a select statement? This question has been a big enigma for me for a long time, and researching and really understanding the process has helped me improve the way I've been programming from then on. The process of data retrieval is summarized in the diagram below:

Letâ€™s take a deeper look at the process:

 1. **ABAP Code Execution:** ABAP programs are executed by the Application Server, which allocates resources (like work processes) to run the code.

 2. **Database Interface Processing:** This interface acts as a bridge between the ABAP application and the database. It performs two key tasks: converting ABAP SQL to native SQL and optimizing the query. In ABAP, when you write a `SELECT` statement, you are using ABAP Open SQL, a standardized SQL language provided by SAP that allows developers to write database queries without worrying about the specific SQL dialect of the underlying database (such as Oracle, SAP HANA, or Microsoft SQL Server). Therefore, converting ABAP SQL to native SQL is an essential step in database communication. Before sending the SQL query to the database, the database interface optimizes the query for performance, including the use of buffers or indexes.

 3. **Query Execution on the Database Server:** The primary function of the database server is to store and manage tables, which are saved in the database's disk storage but accessed in memory when queried. The database management system (DBMS) executes the query, evaluates the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause, and uses the query processor to filter, sort, and aggregate the requested data.

 4. **Data Transfer:** In this step, the DBMS returns the resulting data to the application server. This communication process occurs via a network connection.

 5. **Storage in ABAP Memory and Program Use:** The application server receives the information and stores it in suitable ABAP objects (such as internal tables, work areas, or variables) for further processing in the ABAP program.


### What Can You Do In a Select?

When using the `SELECT` statement is possible to adapt it by incorporating aggregation functions, conditions, filters, string manipulations, field operations, grouping, and sorting. Additionally, multiple tables can join multiple tables and limited the amount of data retrieved in the end of the query execution. 

#### AGGREGATION FUNCTIONS

| Functionality | Example  | Description    |
| :----------- | :--------------: | -------------------------: |
| COUNT | ```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table INTO @data(lv_count)```  | Counts the number of records that match the condition |                   | SUM   | ```SELECT SUM(field) FROM table INTO @data(lv_sum)```  | Calculates the sum of the values of a numeric field   |
| AVG   | ```SELECT AVG(field) FROM table INTO @data(lv_avg)```  | Calculates the average of the values of a numeric field |
| MIN   | ```SELECT MIN(field) FROM table INTO @data(lv_min)```  | Finds the smallest value of a numeric field |
| MAX   | ```SELECT MAX(field) FROM table INTO @data(lv_max)```  | Finds the largest value of a numeric field |

#### FILTERING AND CONDITIONS

| Functionality   | Example                                                                         | Description   

| :----------- | :--------------: | -------------------------: |
| WHERE           | `SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'value'.`                                    | Filters records based on a condition.                                           |
| CASE in WHERE   | `SELECT * FROM table WHERE CASE WHEN field1 = 'value1' THEN field2 ELSE field3 END = 'value4'.` | Uses CASE conditions within a WHERE clause for conditional logic. |
| MOD             | `SELECT * FROM table WHERE field MOD 2 = 0.`                                    | Filters records based on divisibility (modulus operation).                      |
| BETWEEN         | `SELECT * FROM table WHERE field BETWEEN 'value1' AND 'value2'.`                | Filters records where a field's value is between two specified values.          |
| LIKE            | `SELECT * FROM table WHERE field LIKE 'ABC%'.`                                  | Searches for patterns in string fields.                                         |
| IN              | `SELECT * FROM table WHERE field IN ('value1', 'value2').`                      | Checks if a field's value is within a specified set of values.                  |
